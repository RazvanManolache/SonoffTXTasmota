# SonoffTXTasmota

Some Berry script to make Sonoff TX Ultimate work okish with Tasmota

nothing to write home about, but considering how badly Berry is documented it may help someone.

It has a small configuration mode, when you long press, where you can change color theme, brigtness, etc.

It should support both lights and blinds. Will probably update it if I actually intend to stabilize, for now it does its job.

# Instructions:

- Have a build with berry and file system enabled (example of user_config_override.h for tasmota build included - it has more stuff than that, was overly ambitious)

- Add the 3 .be files to file system (the txultimate.be is from this repo https://github.com/blakadder/tx-ultimate/)
